His father, also a daily wage labourer, is currently ailing and bedridden. In the absence of any steady income, the family of seven has to subsist on one meal a day consisting merely of bread. But Ranjit has smilingly braved “the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune” and secured 85% marks in the 2016 H.S Examinations. His school teachers have provided him with mid-day meal and some books in the past. Ranjit is now studying Geography in the University B.T & Evening College in Cooch Behar. In honour of his unvanquished zeal and perseverance, Srijan Sujan has come forward in his support.</p>\r\n\r\n_To view the academic documents of Ranjit Das please download the zip file or the tar file from the link the top._",
