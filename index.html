          <p><strong>Name :</strong> Ranjit Das</p>

<p><strong>Address :</strong> Village : Barovita, P.O. : Domukha Moamari Nayarhat, District : Cooch Behar</p>

<p><strong>Support Period :</strong> Beneficiary since 2016</p>

<p><strong>Mentor :</strong> Jibesh Kumar Saha (Cooch Behar)</p>

<p><strong>Educational Backgroud :</strong> Madhyamik: 61.3% ; Higher Secondary: 84.8% </p>

<p><strong>Present Course :</strong> Geography (UG I), University B.T. &amp; Evening College, Cooch Behar</p>

<p align="justify"> Ranjit, who hails from the village of Barobhita in Cooch Behar, had to cut and sell grass to fend for himself. His father, also a daily wage labourer, is currently ailing and bedridden. In the absence of any steady income, the family of seven has to subsist on one meal a day consisting merely of bread. But Ranjit has smilingly braved “the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune” and secured 85% marks in the 2016 H.S Examinations. His school teachers have provided him with mid-day meal and some books in the past. Ranjit is now studying Geography in the University B.T &amp; Evening College in Cooch Behar. In honour of his unvanquished zeal and perseverance, Srijan Sujan has come forward in his support.</p>
